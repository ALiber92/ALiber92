👋 Hi! I am Alessandro Liberatore, a young researcher at NASA – Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 🛰 
I analyze data and images from different space-based missions to study the Sun and the Sun-Earth interaction. ☀️ 🌍 
I study the solar atmosphere and eruptive solar events such as Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections.
