👋 Hi! I am Alessandro Liberatore, a young resercer at NASA – Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 🛰 
I work on the data analysis and image processing of different space-based missions to study the Sun and the Sun-Earth interaction. ☀️ 🌍 
In particular, I focus my attention on the study of the solar corona and eruptive solar events such as Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections.
